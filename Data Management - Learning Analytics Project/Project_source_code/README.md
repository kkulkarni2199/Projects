# Final Project

Welcome to Data Management and Exploratory Data Analysis : Learning Analytics!

This project is about the Learning Analytics on the MOOC(Massive Open Online Course) entitled "Cyber Security: Safety At Home, Online, and in Life‚Äù made by Newcastle University and made available to the public by the online skills provider FutureLearn. In this project, I will analyse the FutureLearn dataset and provide some significant insights to the provider FutureLearn.

To setup this project, I have used the ProjectTemplate package in R.

ProjectTemplate is an R package that helps you organize your statistical
analysis projects. To create new project template use `create.project()`.

To load your new project, you'll first need to `setwd()` into the directory
where this README file is located. Then you need to run the following two
lines of R code:

	library('ProjectTemplate')
	load.project()
	
The name of our project directory is Final Project.

The git log produced for this file is in logs folder in the directory.

The Final report and the reflective summary log are in the reports folder in the directory.

The preprocessing script is in munge folder in the directory.

The data used for this project is loaded in data folder of the directory.

For more details about ProjectTemplate, see http://projecttemplate.net

The packages installed in this project can be found in the libraries section in global.dcf file in config folder.

To intall these packages use 'install.packages(package_name)' command.
